                        Hello! I've got over 30 years in software development, developing applications supporting diverse goals such 
                        as personnel distribution and assignment, magazine circulation fulfillment, help desk issues tracking and administration, 
                        sales force hierarchy and commission tracking, and most recently, cable media advertising sales. 
                    </p>
                
                    <p>
                        I'm originally from south Jersey (Go Eagles! Go Phillies!). I got a BA in computer science from Rutgers University, and 
                        served in the US Navy. I spent 3 years on a ship stationed in Rhode Island, and finished my service doing IT work in 
                        enlisted personnel assignment in northern Virginia. For the last twenty years I've supported domestic advertising 
                        sales for Discovery Communications. In the '90s I played drums and guitar in a band here in DC called Racecar. Best 
                        palindrome bandname ever'
                    </p>
                        
                    <p>
                        I'm the proud father of two great kids, Eva and Owen; my wife and I live with them in Silver Spring, MD with our dog, 
                        Mabel. In my free time I enjoy playing guitar (poorly), reading, watching TV, and sneaking in a few minutes on my 
                        son's Xbox.
                    </p>
